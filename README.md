# SMB
SMB - utility for fast swap mouse buttons on Windows OS

# Motivation

I'm 35 years old. After some time small a pain appear in my right hand's wrist. Sounds similar to [Carpal tunnel syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome).
To solve it I started to use left hand more often in daily activity - rotating my car's wheel, clean up the nose and so on.
Using left hand when working on PC is solution too. Especially if one have universal (symmetrical) mouse.
But this doesn't work when playing games. CS:GO, Tank Force and others were created to play mouse on a right hand.
So one should change default mouse action button in Windows OS settings few times a day. To speed up it I wrote SMB utility. Setting could be changed within one click. Simple as it should be.
